First week challenge at [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com). 

This is an introduction to OOP, TDD and pair programming, following the agile methodology taught at Makers. 

The project consists in writing an app for a Boris Bikes docking station. Module mixins are used for refactoring at the end.
